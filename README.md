# Spark-For-MachineLearning

This repository contains hands-on examples of machine learning algorithms implemented using **Apache Spark with Python and MLlib**.

## ðŸ“Œ Project List

###  Project 1: Predict Crew Size for Cruise Ships (Linear Regression with PySpark MLlib)

ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement:
Hyundai Heavy Industries wants to predict how many **crew members** a cruise ship will need based on its features. This helps in planning staff, resources, and costs efficiently.

   Objective:
Use **Linear Regression** with **PySpark MLlib** to build a machine learning model that can estimate the number of crew required based on ship attributes.

   Dataset Overview:
The dataset (`cruise_ship_info.csv`) includes features like:

* `Age`: Age of the ship
* `Tonnage`: Weight/size of the ship
* `Passengers`: Number of passengers the ship can carry
* `Length`, `Cabins`, `Passenger Density`
* `Crew` (target variable to predict)

 ML Approach:

* Use **SparkSession** to read and process the data.
* Perform **exploratory data analysis** with `.show()` and `.describe()`.
* Select relevant numeric features.
* Train a **Linear Regression** model using MLlib.
* Evaluate model performance using regression metrics (e.g., RMSE, RÂ²).

 Skills Practiced:

* Data loading and schema inspection with PySpark
* Feature engineering and selection
* ML model building with Spark MLlib
* Interpretation of linear regression results
* Spark-based big data processing


 ðŸš¢ Project 2: Predicting Titanic Survivors (Logistic Regression with PySpark MLlib)

 Problem Statement:
Using the famous Titanic dataset, build a classification model to predict the **probability of passenger survival** based on features like age, sex, ticket class, and fare. This is a **binary classification** task where the goal is to predict `Survived` (0 = No, 1 = Yes).

Objective:
Apply **Logistic Regression** using PySpark's MLlib library to classify passengers as survived or not.

Dataset Overview:
Key columns used for prediction:

* `Pclass`: Ticket class
* `Sex`: Gender (categorical)
* `Age`: Age of passenger
* `SibSp`: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
* `Parch`: Number of parents/children aboard
* `Fare`: Fare paid
* `Embarked`: Port of Embarkation (categorical)

 Steps:

1. **Load CSV data** into Spark DataFrame.
2. **Select relevant features** and handle missing values using `.na.drop()`.
3. **Transform categorical columns** (`Sex`, `Embarked`) using:

   * `StringIndexer`
   * `OneHotEncoder`
4. **Assemble features** into a single vector using `VectorAssembler`.
5. **Split the data** into training and testing sets.
6. **Train the Logistic Regression model** using a Spark `Pipeline`.
7. **Evaluate** the model using `BinaryClassificationEvaluator`.

 Performance:

* Model AUC (Area Under ROC Curve):
* Output includes survival predictions vs actual values for inspection.

 Skills Practiced:**

* Data cleaning and preprocessing with Spark
* Encoding categorical features
* Building machine learning pipelines in PySpark
* Evaluating binary classification models

4. **Decision Tree & Random Forest**  
   Comparison and evaluation using tree-based classifiers in Spark.

5. **K-means Clustering**  
   Unsupervised learning to group data points.

6. **NIP with MLlib**  
   Neural-inspired processing using Spark.
